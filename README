App-ZofCMS-Plugin-Base

The module is a base class for L<App::ZofCMS> plugins. I'll safely assume that you've
already read the docs for L<App::ZofCMS>,
L<App::ZofCMS::Config> and L<App::ZofCMS::Template>

The base class (currently) is only for plugins who take their "config" as a single
first-level key in either Main Config File or ZofCMS Template. That key's value
must be a hashref.

INSTALLATION
